In addition, BAC agreed to submit a written plan to strengthen BAC’s compliance risk management program regarding those same\\ncompetitively bid transactions, and to promptly implement that plan once it is approved by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond.  BANA Muni\\nDerivative Settlement  The Comptroller of the Currency (the “Comptroller”) reviewed certain activities\\nrelated to the participation of certain employees of Bank of America, N.A. (“BANA”) in the sale of certain derivative financial products to municipalities and non-profit organizations, and found information indicating that certain\\nBANA employees engaged in illegal bidding activity related to the sale of those derivative financial products variously between 1998 and January 2004.\\xa0Following the review, BANA and the Comptroller entered into a Formal Written Agreement on\\nDecember\\xa07, 2010, to ensure that BANA proactively and appropriately manages its compliance risk related to various competitively bid transactions, including those related to derivative financial products to municipalities and non-profit\\norganizations.  In addition, BANA agreed to do a formal assessment of all business lines that engage in certain types of\\ncompetitively bid transactions, to complete a formal evaluation of the operational policies and procedures applicable to such businesses to ensure that adequate policies and procedures exist to ensure compliance with safe and sound banking\\npractices, law, and regulations related to the competitively bid transactions, and to develop an internal training program to ensure compliance with all laws and regulations related to competitively bid transactions.\\xa0Upon approval by the\\nComptroller, BANA must immediately begin to implement the policies, procedures and programs called for by the Agreement.\\xa0Finally, BANA agreed to pay unjust enrichment in the amount of $9,217,218 to certain counterparties indentified by the\\nComptroller. Merrill Lynch (as successor to BAS) Muni Derivative Settlement \\nOn December\\xa07, 2010, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) issued an administrative and cease-and-desist\\norder (the “Order”) finding that Banc of America Securities LLC (“BAS”) (which was merged with and into Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner\\xa0& Smith Incorporated (“Merrill Lynch”) on 11/01/2010)\\nwillfully violated Section\\xa015(c)(1)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 when certain employees participated in improper bidding practices involving the temporary investment of proceeds of tax-exempt municipal securities in\\n\\n \\xa0 Page 14 of 30\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\nreinvestment products during the period 1998-2002. The Order censured BAS, ordered BAS to cease and desist from committing or causing such violations and future violations, and ordered BAS to pay\\ndisgorgement plus prejudgment interest in the amount of $36,096,442.00. BAS consented to the Order without admitting or denying the SEC’s findings. Merrill Lynch 529 Plan AWC  On November\\xa023, 2010, the Financial\\nIndustry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) alleged that Merrill Lynch violated MSRB Rule G-27 in that during the period January 2002 to February 2007, Merrill Lynch required registered representatives to consider potential state tax\\nbenefits offered by a state in which a client resides as a factor when recommending a client invest in a 529 plan. But Merrill Lynch’s written supervisory procedures did not require supervisors to document reviews to determine if registered\\nrepresentatives had in fact considered potential state tax benefits when recommending a client invest in a 529 plan. As a result, Merrill Lynch did not have effective procedures relating to documenting its suitability determinations in connection\\nwith the sale of 529 plans. Without admitting or denying the findings, Merrill Lynch consented to the described sanctions and to the entry of findings; therefore, Merrill Lynch is censured, fined $500,000 and required within 60 days of execution of\\nthis Acceptance, Waiver and Consent (“AWC”) to distribute a stand-alone letter acceptable to FINRA to each current customer who resided in a state that offered 529-related state tax benefits at the time the customer opened an\\nadvisor-sold specific 529 plan account at Merrill Lynch from June 2002 through February 2007; the letter will instruct the customers to call a designated Merrill Lynch phone number with inquiries, concerns or complaints regarding their 529\\ninvestment. The designated number will be available for 120 days after which the number will contain a recorded message to contact Merrill Lynch’s college plan services area. If requested within 180 days of mailing of the 529 letter, Merrill\\nLynch will assist in transferring or rolling-over any customer’s investment in the specific plan into a 529 plan of the customer’s choice within his/her home state, regardless of whether Merrill Lynch currently offers such 529 plan, with\\nMerrill Lynch waiving any and all client fees, costs in connection with the sale, transfer, or roll-over of the specific plan; and/or any and all client fees, costs due to Merrill Lynch in connection with the initial purchase of a 529 plan within\\nthe customer’s home state using the proceeds of the specific plan. Merrill Lynch shall provide FINRA semi-annually or upon FINRA’s request, until December\\xa031, 2011, a report describing each oral/written inquiry, concern or complaint\\nreceived through the designated number or any written complaint otherwise received by Merrill Lynch concerning the specific plan from the 529 letter recipients, along with a description of how Merrill Lynch addressed or resolved the inquiries,\\nconcerns or complaints of each such customer.  Merrill Lynch (as successor to BAI) Massachusetts Consent \\nOn November\\xa017, 2010, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Securities Division alleged that two employees of Banc of America Investment\\nServices, Inc. (“BAI”) (which merged with and into Merrill Lynch on 10/23/2009) sold Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac federal agency step-up bonds to an investor and that they did not describe the bonds accurately. The state regulator\\nalleged that BAI failed to supervise the conduct in violation of M.G.L. C.110a § 204(a)(2)(g). Only BAI was named as a respondent in the consent order. On November\\xa016, 2010, BAI submitted an offer of settlement, without admitting or\\ndenying the facts and without an \\n \\xa0 Page 15 of 30\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\nadjudication of any issue of law or fact, and consented to the entry of the consent order. BAI agreed to a fine of $100,000, to cease and desist, and to an undertaking to retain an independent\\ncompliance consultant and impose heightened supervision on a representative.  Merrill Lynch FINRA UIT AWC \\nOn August\\xa018, 2010, FINRA alleged that Merrill Lynch violated NASD Rules 2110, 2210, 3010—in that Merrill Lynch failed to\\nestablish, maintain and enforce a supervisory system and written supervisory procedures reasonably designed to achieve compliance with its obligations to apply sales charge discounts to all eligible Unit Investment Trust (“UIT”)\\npurchases. Merrill Lynch relied on its brokers to ensure that customers received appropriate UIT sales charge discounts, despite the fact that Merrill Lynch failed to appropriately inform and train brokers and their supervisors about such discounts.\\nMerrill Lynch’s written supervisory procedures had little or no information or guidance regarding UIT sales charge discounts. Once Merrill Lynch established procedures addressing UIT sales charges discounts, they were inaccurate and\\nconflicting. Merrill Lynch’s written supervisory procedures incorrectly stated that a discount would not apply when a client liquidates an existing UIT position and uses the proceeds to purchase a different UIT. Merrill Lynch’s procedures\\nlacked substantive guidelines, instructions, policies, or steps for brokers or their supervisors to follow to determine if a customer’s UIT purchase qualified for and received a sales charge discount. As a result of the defective procedures,\\nMerrill Lynch failed to provide eligible customers with appropriate discounts on both UIT rollover and breakpoint purchases. Merrill Lynch failed to identify and appropriately apply sales charge discounts in transactions reviewed in a sample of\\ncustomer purchases in certain top selling UITS. As a result, Merrill Lynch overcharged customers in this sample approximately $123,000. Following FINRA’s publication of a settlement with another firm concerning UIT transactions and independent\\nof FINRA’s pending inquiry, Merrill Lynch analyzed its application of sales charge discounts to UIT transactions. As a result of the review, Merrill Lynch identified customers that were overcharged when purchasing UITs through Merrill Lynch and\\nin accordance with the undertakings set forth below, will remediate those customers more than $2 million in overcharges. Merrill Lynch approved for distribution inaccurate and misleading UIT sales literature and provided this UIT presentation for\\nbrokers to use with clients. This presentation was subject to the content standards set forth in NASD Rule 2210(d) and violated those standards. Without admitting or denying the findings, Merrill Lynch consented to the described sanctions and to the\\nentry of findings; therefore, Merrill Lynch is censured, fined $500,000 and agrees to provide remediation to customers who, during the relevant period, purchased UITs and qualified for, but did not receive, the applicable sales charge discount.\\nWithin 90 days of the effective date of this AWC, Merrill Lynch submitted to FINRA a proposed plan of how it will identify and compensate customers who qualified for, but did not receive, the applicable UIT sales charge discounts. The date that\\nFINRA notifies Merrill Lynch that it does not object to the plan shall be called the notice date. In the event FINRA does object to the plan, Merrill Lynch will have an opportunity to address FINRA’s objections and resubmit the plan within 30\\ndays. A failure to resubmit to FINRA a plan that is reasonably designed to meet the specific requirements and general purpose of the undertaking will be a violation of the terms of the AWC. Merrill Lynch shall complete the remediation process within\\n180 days from the notice date. Within 210 days of the notice date, Merrill Lynch will submit to FINRA a schedule of all customers identified during Merrill Lynch’s review as not having received an appropriate sales charge\\n\\n \\xa0 Page 16 of 30\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\ndiscount. The schedule shall include details of the qualifying purchases and the appropriate discount and total dollar amounts of restitution provided to each customer. Also within 210 days from\\nthe notice date, Merrill Lynch will submit to FINRA a report that explains how Merrill Lynch corrected its UIT systems and procedures and the results of Merrill Lynch’s implementation of its plan to identify and compensate qualifying customers\\nincluding the amounts and manner of all restitution paid.  Merrill Lynch NASDAQ Settlement \\nOn June\\xa029, 2010, the NASDAQ Stock Market (“NASDAQ”) alleged that Merrill Lynch violated NASDAQ RULES 2110, 3010 in\\nthat Merrill Lynch’s supervisory system and written supervisory procedures were not reasonably designed to achieve compliance with applicable securities laws and regulations (including NASD notice to members 04-66) and NASDAQ rules concerning\\nthe prevention of erroneous orders and transactions and frivolous clearly erroneous transaction complaints. Without admitting or denying the findings, Merrill Lynch consented to the described sanctions and to the entry of findings; therefore,\\nMerrill Lynch is censured, fined $10,000 and required to revise its written supervisory procedures regarding compliance with NASD Notice to Members 04-66 within 30 business days of acceptance of this AWC by the NASDAQ review council. \\nBAC ML&Co. Proxy Rule Settlement  The SEC alleged that BAC violated the federal proxy rules by failing to disclose information concerning Merrill Lynch\\xa0& Co., Inc.’s (“ML&Co.”) known and estimated losses\\nin the fourth quarter of 2008 prior to the shareholder vote on December\\xa05, 2008 to approve the merger between the two companies. In addition, the SEC alleged that Bank of America Corporation (the “Corporation”) violated\\nSection\\xa014(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) and Rule 14a-9 thereunder by failing to disclose in the Corporation’s joint proxy statement filed on November\\xa03, 2008 the incentive\\ncompensation that Merrill Lynch\\xa0& Co., Inc. could, in its discretion, award to its employees prior to completion of its merger with the Corporation. On February\\xa024, 2010, a final judgment (the “Final Judgment”) was\\nentered by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York in both matters. Under the terms of the Final Judgment, BAC agreed to pay $1 in disgorgement and a $150 million civil penalty to be distributed to shareholders as part of the\\nSEC’s Fair Funds Program at a later date in accordance with further order of the court. In addition, as part of the Final Judgment, BAC agreed, for a period of three years, to comply with and maintain certain requirements related to BAC’s\\ncorporate governance and disclosure practices.  Merrill Lynch CBOE Decision and Order of Offer of Settlement \\nOn April\\xa013, 2010, the Chicago Board of Options Exchange (“CBOE”) censured and fined Merrill Lynch $150,000. In\\naddition, the BCC ordered an undertaking requiring Merrill Lynch to provide the Exchange with a certification within thirty (30)\\xa0days of the issuance of the decision in this matter that Merrill Lynch has corrected the systems problems leading\\nto this case, that all information reported to the Exchange in accordance with Rule 4.13(a) is accurate and is being submitted on a timely basis, and that respondent immediately notify the Exchange of\\n\\n \\xa0 Page 17 of 30\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\nany inaccuracies in any reports submitted pursuant to rule 4.13(a). During all relevant periods herein, Exchange members were required to submit to the large options position report all customer\\npositions, which numbered 200 contracts or more in any single option class listed on the Exchange on the same side of the market along with their customer’s name, address, and social security number or tax identification number. Merrill Lynch\\nfailed to properly submit all required account information for approximately 1,346 accounts to the large options position report. (CBOE Rule 4.13(a) - reports related to position limits.)  Merrill Lynch Client Associate Registration Settlement  In September 2009,\\nMerrill Lynch reached agreements in principle and final administrative settlements with the Texas State Securities Board and various state securities regulators relating to the state registration of sales assistants known as Client Associates.\\nWithout admitting or denying wrongdoing, Merrill Lynch agreed to certain undertakings and regulatory sanctions including reprimand or censure, agreement to cease and desist sales of securities through persons not registered with the states, payments\\nof fines, penalties and other monetary sanctions (including past registration fees) of $26,563,094.50 to be divided amongst the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and payment of $25,000 to the North\\nAmerican Securities Administrators Association.  Merrill Lynch, BAI and BAS Auction Rate Securities Settlements \\nIn August 2008, Merrill Lynch, BAS and BAI\\xa0each reached certain agreements in principal and final settlements with the Office of the\\nNew York State Attorney General, the Massachusetts Securities Division, various state securities regulators, and the staff of the SEC (the “ARS Settlements”) relating to auction rate securities (“ARS”).\\xa0As the\\nresult of the mergers of BAI with and into Merrill Lynch on October\\xa023, 2009 and BAS with and into Merrill Lynch on November\\xa01, 2010, Merrill Lynch assumed the liabilities of BAI and BAS in this matter.\\xa0Without admitting or denying\\nwrongdoing, each of the aforementioned entities has agreed to, pursuant to the terms of each settlement to which it is a party, among others, repurchase ARS at par value (plus any accrued but unpaid interest or dividends) from certain eligible\\ncustomers, use best efforts to provide liquidity solutions for institutional holders of ARS, participate in a special arbitration process to the extent that eligible customers believe they have a claim for consequential damages, refund certain\\nrefinancing fees related to ARS, pay a civil money penalty and compensate other eligible customers who purchased ARS and sold them at a loss.\\xa0Each of Merrill Lynch, BAS and BAI has substantially completed the purchase of those ARS.\\xa0BAI and\\nBAS also agreed to pay a total civil penalty of $50,000,000 that will be distributed among the states and U.S. territories that enter into administrative or civil consent orders related to ARS.\\xa0Merrill Lynch agreed to pay a $125,000,000.00\\ncivil penalty that will be distributed similarly.  BAI Representative Supervision Settlement \\nOn October\\xa022, 2009, the SEC alleged that BAI failed reasonably to supervise a former registered representative who converted certain\\ncustomer funds, with a view to preventing and detecting violations of Federal securities laws, as required under Section\\xa015(B)(4)(E) of the \\n \\xa0 Page 18 of 30\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). Without admitting or denying the allegations, BAI agreed to enter into a settlement with the SEC, paid a civil money penalty\\nin the amount of $150,000, and to comply with certain undertakings. Such undertakings include retaining an independent consultant to review and evaluate the effectiveness of BAI’s supervisory and compliance systems, policies, and procedures\\nconcerning the following: (1)\\xa0review of customer accounts and securities transactions; and (2)\\xa0periodic compliance inspections. BAI has undertaken to adopt, implement, and maintain all policies, procedures, and practices recommended by the\\nindependent consultant. Notwithstanding the settlement with the SEC, BAI has identified the customers whose funds were converted by the former BAI registered representative, and has reimbursed them in full. \\nMerrill Lynch Squawk Box Settlement  On March\\xa011, 2009, without admitting or denying the SEC’s findings, Merrill Lynch consented to the entry of an administrative SEC order that (1)\\xa0finds violations of Section\\xa015(f) of\\nthe Exchange Act and Section\\xa0204A of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the “Advisers Act”) for allegedly failing to maintain written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent the misuse of customer order\\ninformation, (2)\\xa0requires that Merrill Lynch cease and desist from committing or causing any future violations of the provisions charged, (3)\\xa0censures Merrill Lynch, (4)\\xa0imposes a $7,000,000 civil money penalty and (5)\\xa0requires\\nMerrill Lynch to comply with certain undertakings.  Merrill Lynch Consulting Services Settlement \\nOn January\\xa030, 2009, Merrill Lynch, without admitting or denying any findings of misconduct by the SEC, consented to the entry of an\\nadministrative order by the SEC (the “Order”) that (i)\\xa0finds that Merrill Lynch violated Advisers Act Sections 204 and 206(2), and Rule 204-2(a)(14) thereunder; (ii)\\xa0requires that Merrill Lynch cease and desist from\\ncommitting or causing any violation or further violations of the provisions charged; (iii)\\xa0censures Merrill Lynch pursuant to Advisers Act Section\\xa0203(e); and (iv)\\xa0requires Merrill Lynch to pay a civil money penalty of $1 million. The\\nOrder finds that Merrill Lynch, through its pension consulting services advisory program, breached its fiduciary duty to certain current and prospective pension fund clients by misrepresenting and omitting to disclose material information.\\n MLPF&S FINRA OATS/TRACE AWC  On September\\xa024, 2008, FINRA alleged that Merrill Lynch violated SEC Rules 10B-10, 17A-3, 17A-4, 200(G) of Regulation SHO, NASD Rules 2110, 2320, 3010, 3110, 4632, 4632(a), 4632(a)(7)[formerly\\n6420(a)(8)], 6130, 6130(d), 6230(c)(6), 6230(e), 6620, 6620(f), 6955(a), Interpretative Material 2110-2, and MSRB Rule G-14 in that . Merrill Lynch, in transactions for or with a customer, failed to use reasonable diligence to ascertain the best\\ninterdealer market and failed to buy or sell in such market so that the resultant price to its customers was as favorable as possible under prevailing market conditions; reported to the Order Audit Trail System (“OATS”) route or\\ncombined order/route reports that OATS was unable to link to the related order routed to SUPERMONTAGE or SELECTNET or corresponding new order submitted by the destination member firm due to inaccurate, incomplete or improperly formatted data;\\nsubmitted to OATS \\n \\xa0 Page 19 of 30\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\nReportable Order Events (“ROES”) that were rejected by OATS for context or syntax errors and failed to repair them; failed to report to the Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine\\n(“TRACE”) the correct contra-party identifier for transactions in TRACE-eligible securities; reported to trace transactions in TRACE-eligible securities it was not required to report; failed to contemporaneously or partially execute\\ncustomer limit orders in NASDAQ securities after it traded each subject security for its own market-making account at a price that would have satisfied each customer’s limit order; failed to report, or timely report, to the NASDAQ Market Center\\n(“NMC”) the cancellations of trades previously submitted to NASDAQ; incorrectly reported to the NMC the 2nd leg of “riskless” principal transactions in designated securities and incorrectly designated the capacity as\\n“principal;” failed to report to the NMC the correct symbol indicating whether it executed transactions in reportable securities in a principal or agency capacity; failed to report to the NMC or the FINRA/NASDAQ Trade Reporting Facility\\n(“FNTRF”) the correct symbol indicating whether transactions were buy, sell, sell short, sell short exempt or cross for transactions in reportable securities; failed to report to the NMC the correct execution time for transactions\\nin reportable securities. Merrill Lynch failed to report, or timely report to the OTC reporting facility the cancellations of trades previously submitted; transmitted to OATS reports that contained inaccurate, incomplete or improperly formatted\\ndata; failed to provide written notification disclosing to its customers that transactions were executed at an average price; failed to provide written notification disclosing its executing capacity in a transaction. Merrill Lynch failed to preserve\\nfor a period of not less than 3 years, the first 2 in an accessible place, brokerage order memoranda; in short sale order transactions, failed to properly mark the orders as short; incorrectly designated as “.W” to the FNTRF last sale\\nreports of designated securities transactions; incorrectly reported to the FNTRF the 2nd leg of “riskless” principal transactions in designated securities because it incorrectly designated the capacity as “principal;” failed to\\nreport to the FNTRF last sale reports of transactions in designated securities; incorrectly designated as “.PRP” one last sale report; failed to report the cancellation of one trade previously submitted; failed to report the correct time\\nof execution of a last sale report; reported the cancellation of one last sale report it was not required to; and failed to report to the FNTRF the correct symbol indicating whether it executed transactions in reportable securities in a principal or\\nagency capacity. Merrill Lynch’s supervisory system did not provide for supervision designed to achieve compliance re: TRACE, quality of markets, transaction reporting, short sales, OATS, etc. Without admitting or denying the findings, Merrill\\nLynch consented to the described sanctions and to the entry of findings; therefore, Merrill Lynch was censured, fined $242,500, and ordered to pay $11,358.65, plus interest, in restitution. A registered principal of Merrill Lynch shall submit\\nsatisfactory proof of payment of the restitution, or of reasonable and documented efforts undertaken to effect restitution no later than 120 days after acceptance of this AWC. Any undistributed restitution and interest shall be forwarded to the\\nappropriate escheat, unclaimed property or abandoned property fund for the state in which the customer last resided. Merrill Lynch shall revise its written supervisory procedures regarding TRACE, quality of markets, OATS receiving inter-firm route\\nmatching statistics, transaction reporting, short sales, short sales bid and tick test compliance, OATS clock synchronization, safe harbor compliance, recordkeeping, limit order protection, the one percent rule, three-quote rule, etc. within 30\\nbusiness days of acceptance of this AWC by the NAC. Within 90 days of acceptance of this AWC, Merrill Lynch’s Compliance Department and trading desks will develop a written plan to improve its compliance in trade reporting, OATS reporting and\\nbest execution over the 12 months following acceptance of this AWC; identify individuals \\n \\xa0 Page 20 of 30\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\nresponsible for overseeing supervision in these areas; and identify the resources needed to improve its compliance. At the conclusion of the 12 months, Merrill Lynch’s Chief Compliance\\nOfficer or designee and one other registered principal from one of the trading desks shall meet with FINRA representatives to describe Merrill Lynch’s progress in these areas.  BAI Maryland Supervision Settlement  On May\\xa021, 2008, the Maryland\\nSecurities Commissioner found that BAI failed to reasonably supervise two agents who misappropriated monies from customers within the meaning of Section\\xa011-412(a)(10) of the Maryland Securities Act. Pursuant to a consent order, BAI agreed to\\npay a $10,000 fine, cease and desist from further violations, and incorporate certain remedial measures into supervisory program.

BAS NYSE\\nETFS Decision  On October\\xa04, 2007, without admitting or denying guilt, BAS consented to findings that it violated: 1.\\nNYSE Rule 401(A) by failing to adhere to the principals of good business practice in that BAS failed to ensure the delivery of prospectuses in connection with certain sales of registered securities in violation of Section\\xa05(B)(2) of the\\nSecurities Act of 1933; 2. NYSE Rule 1100(B) by failing to deliver product descriptions to customers that purchased Exchange traded funds (“ETFs”); and 3. NYSE Rule 342 by failing to provide for, establish and maintain appropriate\\nprocedures of supervision and control including a system of follow-up and review, with respect to its operational and technological activities relating to the delivery of product descriptions and prospectuses with respect to ETF shares and an\\noffering of a certain equity security. BAS stipulated to the following sanctions: The imposition by the NYSE of : 1. Censure; 2. A fine in the amount of $375,000; and 3. An undertaking to provide enforcement with a written certification that its\\ncurrent policies and procedures, including written supervisory and operational policies and procedures, regarding the delivery of prospectuses and product descriptions are reasonably designed to ensure compliance with the Federal securities laws and\\nNYSE rules applicable to the delivery of prospectuses and product descriptions. BAS provided the NYSE with this written certification within 90 days from the date the hearing panel made the decision in this matter final. \\n \\xa0 Page 22 of 30\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n BAS NASD OATS AWC  On May\\xa029, 2007, the NASD alleged that BAS transmitted to OATS execution reports that contained inaccurate, incomplete or improperly formatted data so that the OATS system was unable to link the\\nexecution reports to the related trade reports in an NASD trade reporting system; erroneously reported to OATS execution codes with the exception code of “R” for riskless principal trades it reported under the alternative approach; failed\\nto ROES that were rejected by OATS for context and syntax errors and were repairable; submitted to OATS route or combined order/route reports that the OATS system was unable to link to the related order routed to the NASDAQ exchange or to the\\ncorresponding new order submitted by the destination member firm due to inaccurate, incomplete or improperly formatted data; failed, within 90 seconds after execution, to transmit to the trade reporting facility last sale reports of transactions in\\ndesignated securities; failed, within 90 seconds, to transmit to the OTC reporting facility last sale reports of transactions in OTC equity securities; reported last sale reports of transactions in designated securities to the trade reporting\\nfacility it was not required to report; failed to report to TRACE the correct contra-party’s identifier for transactions in TRACE-eligible securities; BAS’s supervisory system did not provide for supervision reasonably designed to achieve\\ncompliance with applicable securities laws, regulations and NASD rules concerning TRACE reporting, order handling and soft dollar accounts and trading; and transmitted to OATS reports that contained inaccurate, incomplete or improperly formatted\\ndata. Without admitting or denying the findings, BAS consented to the described sanctions and to the entry of findings; therefore, BAS is censured, fined $60,000 and required to revise BAS’s written supervisory procedures concerning TRACE\\nreporting, order handling and soft dollar accounts and trading within 30 business days of acceptance of this AWC by the NAC.  BAS NASD ACT\\nSettlement  On March\\xa012, 2007, the NASD alleged that BAS failed to accept or decline in the automated confirmation\\ntransaction system (“ACT”) transactions in eligible securities within 20 minutes after execution. The findings stated that BAS failed, within 90 seconds after execution, to transmit through ACT last sale reports of transactions in\\nNASDAQ National Market (“NNM”), NASDAQ SMALLCAP (“SC”) securities and OTC equity securities. The findings also stated that BAS failed to enforce its written supervisory procedures for trade reporting and failed to\\ndesignate as “.T” through ACT last sale reports of transactions in OTC equity securities executed outside normal market hours. The findings also included that BAS transmitted to OATS reports that contained inaccurate, incomplete or\\nimproperly formatted data, effected short sales in certain securities for BAS’s proprietary account and failed to make/annotate an affirmative determination that BAS could borrow the securities or otherwise provide for delivery of the\\nsecurities by settlement date. The NASD found that BAS executed short sale orders and failed to properly mark the order tickets as short for those orders; failed to provide written notification disclosing to its customers its correct capacity in the\\ntransaction, that the transaction was executed at an average price and that it was a market maker. The NASD also found that BAS failed to report to ACT the correct symbol indicating whether the transaction was a buy, sell, sell\\n\\n \\xa0 Page 23 of 30\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\nshort, sell short exempt or cross for transactions in eligible securities. In addition, the NASD determined that BAS’s supervisory system did not provide for supervision reasonably designed\\nto achieve compliance with respect to the applicable securities laws, regulations and NASD rules concerning registration, SEC Rule 11AC1-6, short sales, bid test and books and records. Without admitting or denying the findings, BAS consented to the\\ndescribed sanctions and to the entry of findings, therefore, BAS was censured, fined $56,500 and required to revise its written supervisory procedures and supervisory enforcement with respect to registrations, SEC Rule 11AC1-6, short sales, bid test\\nand books and records.  BAS Research Settlement  On March\\xa014, 2007, neither admitting nor denying the findings, BAS entered into an Offer of Settlement with the SEC to settle allegations that BAS violated sections 15(c) and 15 (f)\\xa0of the\\nExchange Act and Rule 15c1-2(a) promulgated thereunder. The SEC’s Order finds that, during the period of January 1999 through December 2001, BAS violated the antifraud and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws in connection\\nwith BAS’ issuance of research. The SEC Order provides that BAS is censured; BAS shall cease and desist from committing or causing any future violations of Sections 15(c) and 15(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 15c1-2(a) promulgated thereunder;\\nBAS shall pay a civil money penalty of $6 million for violations of Section\\xa015(f) of the Exchange Act and $10 million in disgorgement plus a civil money penalty of $10 million for its violations of Section\\xa015(c) of the Exchange Act; and\\nBAS shall comply with certain undertakings. The SEC Order provides that; (1)\\xa0within 30 days, BAS shall retain a qualified independent consultant to conduct a comprehensive review of BAS’ policies, practices and procedures to prevent the\\nmisuse of material nonpublic information concerning BAS research, to determine the adequacy of such policies, practices and procedures under Section\\xa015(f) of the Exchange Act and to prepare a report reviewing the adequacy of BAS’ current\\npolicies, practices, and procedures and making recommendations regarding how BAS should modify or supplement the policies, practices, and procedures to prevent the misuse of material nonpublic information in compliance with Section\\xa015(f);\\n(2)\\xa0within 120 days of BAS’ receipt of said consultant’s report, BAS shall adopt and implement all recommendations set forth in the consultant’s report; (3)\\xa0within 30 days, BAS must undertake to conduct a review of the\\nimplementation and effectiveness of BAS’ policies and procedures relating to its equity research and investment banking operations to ensure compliance with all terms of the Order and provide a written report to the SEC setting forth its\\nfindings and its recommendations regarding any revisions or improvements to BAS’s policies and procedures necessary or appropriate to ensure compliance with all terms of the Order; and (4)\\xa0within 30 days of the report outlined in\\n(3)\\xa0above, BAS must undertake to adopt and implement all recommendations of the report and certify that BAS’s policies and procedures relating to equity research and investment banking operations ensure compliance with all terms of the\\nOrder.  Merrill Lynch Virginia Settlement  On October\\xa024, 2006, the Virginia Division of Securities (the “Division”) alleged that Merrill Lynch: (1)\\xa0violated Securities Rule 21 VAC 5-20-260 B by failing to exercise\\ndiligent supervision over the securities activities of all of its agents, including instances of over-burdened branch management; (2)\\xa0violated Securities Rule 21 VAC 5-20-280 A 3, by failing to maintain\\n\\n \\xa0 Page 24 of 30\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\nall information known about customers contained in the FFRS and Merrill Lynch’s internal computer designation for client account profiles (“KDIS”), including the failure to\\nreconcile such information between the FFRS and the KDI system, and by failing to establish a supervisory review to ensure that appropriate disclosures were documented when it offered only the State of Maine 529 plan without comparison of this plan\\nto Virginia’s in-state 529 plan; and (3)\\xa0violated Securities Rule 21 VAC 5-20-280 A 12 by failing to consistently notify certain clients with MLUA accounts of the difference between the fees they had incurred in the MLUA program and the\\nstandard transaction charges they would have been charged had the account not been in MLUA. Merrill Lynch neither admitted, nor denied the allegations, but Merrill Lynch admitted to the Division’s jurisdiction over the matter and agreed to and\\nhas changed its policies and procedures to correct the criticisms noted. Merrill Lynch also has fulfilled its obligations for SEC-2003-00041 and Merrill Lynch has paid $75,000 to the Division to defray the cost of the investigation. \\nBAC AML Settlement  On\\nSeptember\\xa028, 2006, BAC entered into a civil settlement agreement with the New York County District Attorney. The agreement provides that, from about 2002 to 2004, BAC had deficiencies in certain internal anti-money laundering controls and\\nfailed to react appropriately to the risk presented by certain South American money services business customers who moved funds illegally through BAC. The agreement requires BAC to make a total payment of $7.5 million, to cooperate with the New York\\nCounty District Attorney in ongoing investigations and to abide by anti-money laundering changes recommended by BAC’s regulators.  BAS\\nNASD MSRB Rule Violation Settlement  On August\\xa017, 2006, BAS filed eight MSRB Forms G-36(OS) and (ARD) in an untimely\\nmanner in that they were filed from one to five days late. BAS also failed to establish and maintain a supervisory system reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the filing requirements of MSRB Rule G-36. Without admitting or denying the\\nfindings, BAS consented to sanctions and to the entry of findings; therefore, BAS is censured, fined $13,000, and ordered to certify in writing to the NASD its compliance with the filing requirements of MSRB Rule G-36, on a quarterly basis for a\\nperiod of one year, commencing with the third quarter of 2006.

The NASD asserted that such purported actions violated NASD Rules 2110, 3010, 6230(A) and 6230(E). Without admitting or denying\\nthe allegations, BAI consented to a censure, a fine of $17,500 and an undertaking to revise its written supervisory procedures regarding accurate TRACE reporting within 30 business days of acceptance of the AWC. \\n \\xa0 Page 25 of 30\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Merrill Lynch 2006 ARS Settlement \\nAs part of a settlement relating to managing auctions for ARS, the SEC accepted the offers of settlement of 15 broker-dealer firms,\\nincluding Merrill Lynch, and issued a settlement order on May\\xa031, 2006. The SEC found, and Merrill Lynch neither admitted nor denied, that respondents (including Merrill Lynch) violated section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 by managing\\nauctions for ARS in ways that were not adequately disclosed or that did not conform to disclosed procedures. Merrill Lynch consented to a cease and desist order, a censure, a $1,500,000 civil money penalty, and compliance with certain undertakings\\nto provide customers with written descriptions of Merrill Lynch’s material auction practices and procedures and to implement procedures reasonably designed to prevent and detect failures by Merrill Lynch to conduct auctions for auction rate\\nsecurities in accordance with disclosed procedures.  BAS 2006 ARS Settlement \\nOn May\\xa031, 2006, without admitting or denying the findings, BAS consented to the entry of an Order that alleged that BAS had violated\\nSection\\xa017(A)(2) of the Securities Act.

Not\\nlater than 6 months after the date of this order, unless otherwise extended by the staff of the SEC for good cause shown, BAS’s chief executive officer or general counsel shall certify in writing to the staff of the SEC that respondent has\\nimplemented procedures that are reasonably designed to prevent and detect failures by BAS to conduct the auction process in accordance with the auction procedures disclosed in the disclosure documents and any supplemental disclosures and that BAS is\\nin compliance with this order.  Merrill Lynch NASD NNM AWC  On March\\xa023, 3006, the NASD alleged that Merrill Lynch failed to submit, for the offsetting “riskless” portion of three (3)\\xa0transactions in NASDAQ NNM either a clearing-only report\\nwith a capacity indicator of “riskless principal” or a non-tape, non-clearing report with a capacity indicator of “riskless principal”; incorrectly designated as “.PRP” through ACT last sale reports of two\\n(2)\\xa0transactions in NNM securities; in seven (7)\\xa0instances failed to report the correct time of execution through ACT the last sale reports of transactions in eligible securities for which Merrill Lynch has recording and reporting\\nobligations; in ten (10)\\xa0instances failed to report to ACT the correct symbol indicating whether Merrill Lynch executed transactions in eligible securities as principal, riskless principal, or agent; in two (2)\\xa0instances failed to report\\nto ACT \\n \\xa0 Page 26 of 30\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\nthe correct symbol indicating whether transactions in eligible securities were a buy, sell, sell short, sell short exempt, or cross; failed within 90 seconds after execution, to transmit through\\nACT last sale reports of three (3)\\xa0transactions in Consolidated Quotation System (“CQS”) securities and failed to designate through ACT such last sale reports as late; inaccurately reported the price through ACT of one\\n(1)\\xa0last sale report of a transaction in a CQS security; in September 2003, failed to accurately report the cumulative number of shares of covered orders cancelled prior to execution in National Market System securities that it received for\\nexecution from any person and erroneously included “not held” orders in the report; failed in orders to provide written notification disclosing to customers its correct capacity to the transaction for two (2)\\xa0orders; failed in two\\n(2)\\xa0instances to provide written notification disclosing to its customers the correct reported price; for a total of three (3)\\xa0failed to show either the correct time of receipt and/or the execution on the memorandum of brokerage orders; it\\nis also alleged that Merrill Lynch failed to show the terms and conditions on the memorandum of brokerage orders for five (5)\\xa0orders; and Merrill Lynch’s supervisory system failed to provide for supervision reasonably designed to achieve\\ncompliance with applicable securities laws, regulations and NASD rules concerning the registration of associated persons, the front-running of orders in CQS securities, SEC rules 11AC1-5 and 11AC1-6, and NASD’s three quote rule. Denying the\\nallegations, Merrill Lynch consented to a censure and $45,000 fine, as well as undertakings to revise Merrill Lynch’s written supervisory procedures concerning the aforementioned allegations. \\nMerrill Lynch NASD ISAS AWC  On March\\xa015, 2006, the NASD alleged that Merrill Lynch did not have an adequate supervisory system and procedures that were reasonably designed to oversee the activities of its investment service\\nadvisors (“ISAs”) at the FAC and that certain of the ISAs engaged in a pattern of mutual fund switch recommendations that were accompanied by misrepresentations and omissions of facts to customers. It is also alleged that Merrill\\nLynch permitted individuals lacking the proper licenses as securities principals to be responsible for the supervision of the ISAs and that Merrill Lynch employed an insufficient number of registered principals to review all of the transactions. It\\nis further alleged that in 2002, the FAC conducted three sales contests which improperly awarded non-cash compensation to ISAs based solely on the sale of Merrill Lynch’s proprietary mutual funds. Contests must be based on total sales of all\\nproducts within a single category, such as mutual funds. It is alleged that Merrill Lynch failed to disclose that the ISAs often had five years or less brokerage experience, and that when making recommendations regarding securities, they were\\nlimited to mutual funds. Finally, it is alleged that Merrill Lynch among other things, lacked adequate written supervisory procedures regarding mutual funds recommendations (including switch transactions); did not conduct annual compliance audits\\nfor two years and mutual fund switches were not adequately reviewed by Merrill Lynch principals. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Merrill Lynch consented to the described sanctions and to the entry of findings; therefore, Merrill Lynch\\nwas censured and fined 5,000,000.00. Merrill Lynch was also ordered to retain an independent consultant to recommend corrective measures to Merrill Lynch policies and supervisory and compliance procedures and systems for the FAC. Until those\\ncorrective measures were implemented, Merrill Lynch imposed special supervisory procedures including monitoring calls between FAC personnel and customers. \\n \\xa0 Page 27 of 30\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Merrill Lynch E-Mail Communications Settlement \\nOn March\\xa013, 2006, Merrill Lynch entered into a settlement with the SEC whereby the SEC alleged, and Merrill Lynch neither admitted\\nnor denied, that Merrill Lynch failed to furnish promptly to representatives of the SEC electronic mail communications (“e-mails”) as required under Section\\xa017(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-4(j) thereunder. The SEC also alleged,\\nand Merrill Lynch neither admitted nor denied, that Merrill Lynch failed to retain certain e-mails related to its business as such in violation of Section\\xa017(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-4(b)(4) thereunder. Pursuant to the terms of the\\nsettlement, Merrill Lynch consented to a cease and desist order, a censure, a civil money penalty of $2,500,000 and compliance with certain undertakings relating to the retention of e-mails and the prompt production of e-mails to the SEC.\\n Merrill Lynch NYSE and AMEX Decisions  On February\\xa017, 2006, the New York Stock Exchange Division of Enforcement (“NYSE”) and the American Stock Exchange (“AMEX”) alleged that Merrill Lynch failed to\\nsubmit accurate electronic blue sheets in response to requests for such information from the Exchanges; failed to establish and maintain appropriate systems and procedures for the blue sheet reporting requirements; and failed to establish a separate\\nsystem of follow-up and review to reasonably ensure compliance with Exchange rules pertaining to preparation and submission of electronic blue sheets. A stipulation and consent to penalty was executed agreeing to a fine of $250,000 which was paid by\\nMerrill Lynch on 2/23/2006, as well as a censure and data validation. Merrill Lynch informed the NYSE and AMEX in writing that validation had been completed. \\n \\xa0 Page 28 of 30\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'"

       "'\\n\\n\\n**\\nWestcliff Trust may be deemed to beneficially own 71.6% of the Issuer’s issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares, based upon 38,252,399 Ordinary Shares outstanding,\\nwhich is the sum of (i) 10,870,275 Ordinary Shares issued and outstanding as reported by the Issuer on its Form 6-K, filed with the US Securities Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on November 26, 2012, plus (ii) the 27,382,054 Ordinary\\nShares that would be issuable to Westcliff Trust upon conversion of the Series\\xa03 Notes. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCUSIP No. Q62163110\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n Page\\n 3\\n of 5 \\xa0\\n ITEM\\xa01. SECURITY AND ISSUER. \\nThis Statement of Beneficial Ownership on Schedule 13D (this “Statement”) relates to the Ordinary Shares of Mission NewEnergy\\nLimited, an Australian corporation (the “Issuer”) and is being filed pursuant to Rule 13d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). The address of the principal executive offices of the Issuer\\nis Unit 2B, 431 Roberts Road, Subiaco, Western Australia 6008, Australia.  ITEM\\xa02. IDENTITY AND BACKGROUND. \\n(a) This Statement is being filed by Westcliff Trust, a trust formed under the laws of the State of Texas (the “Trust”).\\n (b) The address of the principal office of the Trust is 7941 Katy Freeway #529, Houston, Texas 77024. \\n(c) The principal business of the Trust is to hold, administer, and distribute its assets for the benefit of its beneficiaries.\\n (d) The Trust has not, during the last five years, been convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or\\nsimilar misdemeanors).  (e) The Trust has not, during the last five years, been a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or\\nadministrative body of competent jurisdiction, and as a result of such proceeding, was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities\\nlaws or finding any violation with respect to such laws.  ITEM\\xa03. SOURCE AND AMOUNT OF FUNDS OR OTHER CONSIDERATION. \\nOn August\\xa024, 2012, the Trust purchased 63,238 of the Issuer’s A$65 face-value Series\\xa02 Convertible Notes, which bore\\ninterest at a rate of 4.00%\\xa0per annum, payable semi-annually, and had a conversion ratio of one note to four Ordinary Shares, resulting in a conversion price of A$16.50 per share (the “Series\\xa02 Notes”), from SLW International,\\nLLC, an entity owned by Stephen L. Way, the creator of the Trust for the benefit of certain of his relatives. The Trust purchased such Series 2 Notes for the purchase price of $402,187.50, 10% of which was paid in cash with funds contributed to the\\nTrust by Mr.\\xa0Way and the remaining 90% of which was borrowed by the Trust from Muragai Financial, LLC, an entity also controlled by Mr.\\xa0Way. Such loan was evidenced by a promissory note bearing interest at the rate of 0.25% and becoming\\ndue on August\\xa01, 2015 and was secured by such Series 2 Notes held by the Trust. On November\\xa023, 2012, the Issuer and the holders of the Series 2 Notes effected an exchange of all outstanding Series\\xa02 Notes for newly issued\\nSeries\\xa03 Notes in a transaction approved by the holders of the Issuer’s Ordinary Shares.  ITEM\\xa04. PURPOSE OF TRANSACTION.\\n The purpose of the transaction is investment.  The Trust is filing this Statement because the increased conversion ratio of the Series 3 Notes received by the Trust in exchange for the Series 2 Notes resulted in an increase of the possible beneficial\\nownership of Ordinary Shares by the Trust. As a holder of Series\\xa03 Notes, the Trust may, upon notice to the Issuer, elect to convert all or part of such Series\\xa03 Notes into Ordinary Shares, which could currently result in the Trust holding\\nup to 71.6% of the Issuer’s outstanding Ordinary Shares, assuming that no other holders of the Series 3 Notes exercise their own equivalent conversion rights. If all other holders of the Series\\xa03 Notes fully exercised their rights of\\nconversion, such holders would hold up to 95.3% of the Ordinary Shares in the aggregate. Additionally, under the terms of the Series 3 Notes, among other events, a sale of material assets by the Issuer requires a repayment of the outstanding face\\namount of the Series\\xa03 Notes.  ITEM\\xa05. INTEREST IN SECURITIES OF THE ISSUER. \\nThe following disclosure is based on 10,870,275 Ordinary Shares outstanding as of November\\xa023, 2012, as reported in the\\nForm\\xa06-K, filed by the Issuer with the SEC on November\\xa026, 2012:  (a)\\xa0As of the date hereof, the Trust may be\\ndeemed to beneficially own an aggregate of 27,382,054 Ordinary Shares, consisting of Ordinary Shares that would be issuable to the Trust upon conversion of the Series\\xa03 Notes held by the Trust, which represents approximately 71.6% of the\\nOrdinary Shares of the Issuer, assuming that no other holders of Series 3 Notes exercise their own equivalent conversion rights.  (b)\\xa0Except as described in Item\\xa06 below, the Trust has sole voting power over and sole power to dispose of the securities identified in Item\\xa05(a) above. \\n(c) Except as described in Item\\xa03 of this Statement, the Trust has not effected any transaction in the Ordinary Shares during the 60\\ndays preceding the date hereof. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCUSIP No. Q62163110\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n Page\\n 4\\n of 5 \\xa0\\n (d) The trustee of the Trust, John Knox, Jr., has the right to receive dividends from,\\nor the proceeds from the sale of, such securities on behalf of the Trust.  (e) Not applicable. \\nITEM\\xa06. CONTRACTS, ARRANGEMENTS, UNDERSTANDINGS OR RELATIONSHIPS WITH RESPECT TO SECURITIES OF THE ISSUER. \\nUnder the Security Agreement-Pledge securing the promissory note described in Item\\xa03 above, upon the occurrence of an event of\\ndefault, Muragai Financial, LLC would have the right to exercise any voting rights that may be available and to dispose of or direct the disposition of the Series 3 Notes or any securities into which they may be converted. Further, prior to the\\noccurrence of an event of default the Trust may not sell or otherwise dispose of any such securities without the prior written consent of Muragai Financial,\\xa0LLC. Subject to the foregoing, pursuant to the Trust Agreement creating the Trust the\\nTrustee of the Trust has the sole right to vote and dispose of the investments held by the Trust, including the securities of the Issuer held by the Trust, and the beneficiaries of the Trust have the right to withdraw certain amounts from the Trust\\nupon attaining certain ages and meeting certain additional conditions.

PURPOSE\\n      OF TRANSACTION\\n     \\n    The\\n      Shares were acquired in the ordinary course of business by two or more private\\n      investment funds for which Perry Corp. acts as a general partner and/or\\n      investment adviser. The transactions were broker transactions. This Schedule\\n      13D\\n      is being filed as a result of the proposed transaction described\\n      below.\\n     \\n    Lee\\n      Equity Partners, LLC, Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe X, L.P., Perry Capital\\n      LLC, an affiliate of Perry Corp.

A copy of the Proposal Letter is attached hereto as Exhibit\\n      C.\\n     \\n    It\\n      is\\n      contemplated that the proposed transaction would be effected through a merger\\n      of\\n      the Issuer with a wholly owned subsidiary of a new company (the “Acquisition\\n      Company”) that would be formed by Mr. Barasch and certain of the Sponsors’\\nrespective investment funds. As a result of the merger, the Issuer would become\\n      wholly owned by the Acquisition Company. The Reporting Persons anticipate that,\\n      in the proposed transaction, (i) the Reporting Persons would contribute and\\n      roll-over into equity of the Acquisition Company all of the Shares held by\\n      them,\\n      the Cap Z Entities would contribute and roll-over into equity of the Acquisition\\n      Company a significant portion of the Shares held by them and Mr. Barasch would\\n      contribute and roll-over into equity of the Acquisition Company a significant\\n      portion of the Shares beneficially owned by him and (ii) all of the Shares\\n      outstanding at the effective time of the merger not rolled-over into equity\\n      of\\n      the Acquisition Company (including Shares held by the Cap Z Entities and Mr.\\n      Barasch not rolled-over into equity of the Acquisition Company) would be\\n      converted into the right to receive $18.15 per Share in cash.\\n     \\n    The\\n      Sponsors and Mr. Barasch have received a “highly confident” letter from each of\\n      Goldman Sachs Credit Partners L.P. and Banc of America Securities LLC with\\n      respect to proposed debt financing for the proposed transaction (together,\\n      the\\n“Debt Financing Letters”). Copies of the Debt Financing Letters are attached\\n      hereto as Exhibit D and Exhibit E, respectively. It is anticipated that the\\n      balance of the cash required to finance the proposed transaction would be\\n      provided as equity capital by certain of the Sponsors’ respective investment\\n      funds.\\n     \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n        \\n      \\n      \\n        \\n        \\n        \\n          \\n        \\n      \\n      \\n        \\n        \\n        CUSIP\\n          No.\\n          913377107                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Page 6\\n          of 20 Pages\\n      \\n    \\n    The\\n      information set forth in this Item 4 is qualified by reference to the Proposal\\n      Letter and the Debt Financing Letters, which are incorporated herein by\\n      reference.\\n     \\n    The\\n      foregoing should not be construed as an offer to shareholders to purchase\\n      Shares.

Perry Corp. has sole power to vote and sole power to dispose of\\n      5,820,500 Shares. By virtue of his position as President, sole director and\\n      sole\\n      shareholder of Perry Corp., Richard C.

Such “group”\\n      may be deemed to\\n      beneficially own Shares that may be beneficially owned by such persons,\\n      including (i) 1,841,309 Shares reflected in the Form 4 filed by Mr. Barasch\\n      on\\n      October 10, 2006 (the “Barasch Form 4”), as being beneficially owned by Mr.\\n      Barasch (which number, per the Barasch Form 4, includes 500,411 Shares, which\\n      are held directly by, or in trust for, members of Mr. Barasch’s immediate family\\n      and as to which Mr. Barasch disclaimed beneficial ownership), (ii) 918,734\\n      Shares that may be acquired by Mr. Barasch through the exercise of stock\\n      options, as reported by Mr. Barasch to the Reporting Persons and (iii)\\n      20,220,236 Shares reflected in Amendment No. 3 to Schedule 13D filed by the\\n      Cap\\n      Z Entities on October 25, 2006 as being beneficially owned by the Cap Z\\n      Entities.

Except as referred to in this statement, the Reporting Persons currently\\n      do not have actual knowledge of beneficial ownership of Shares by any of the\\n      signatories to the Proposal Letter (other than Perry Capital) and the Reporting\\n      Persons have no pecuniary interest with respect to such Shares. Each of the\\n      Reporting Persons disclaims beneficial ownership of Shares that may be\\n      beneficially owned by Mr. Barasch, the Sponsors and their respective affiliates\\n      (other than Perry Capital and its affiliates), and neither the filing of this\\n      statement nor its contents shall be deemed to constitute an admission to the\\n      contrary, except to the extent of the Reporting Persons’ pecuniary interest\\n      therein.\\n     \\n    (c) There\\n      have been no transactions with respect to the Shares during the sixty days\\n      prior\\n      to the date of this statement on Schedule 13D by either Perry Corp. or Richard\\n      C.

This Schedule\\n      13D\\n      is being filed as a result of the proposed transaction described\\n      below.\\n     \\n    Lee\\n      Equity Partners, LLC, Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe X, L.P., Perry Capital\\n      LLC, an affiliate of Perry Corp. (“Perry Capital”), and Capital Z Partners, Ltd.\\n      (collectively, the “Sponsors”) and Mr. Barasch have submitted to the Issuer’s\\n      board of directors a letter, dated October 24, 2006 (the “Proposal Letter”),\\n      setting forth a proposal for the acquisition of the Issuer for $18.15 per Share\\n      in cash. A copy of the Proposal Letter is attached hereto as Exhibit\\n      C.\\n     \\n    It\\n      is\\n      contemplated that the proposed transaction would be effected through a merger\\n      of\\n      the Issuer with a wholly owned subsidiary of a new company (the “Acquisition\\n      Company”) that would be formed by Mr. Barasch and certain of the Sponsors’\\nrespective investment funds. As a result of the merger, the Issuer would become\\n      wholly owned by the Acquisition Company. The Reporting Persons anticipate that,\\n      in the proposed transaction, (i) the Reporting Persons would contribute and\\n      roll-over into equity of the Acquisition Company all of the Shares held by\\n      them,\\n      the Cap Z Entities would contribute and roll-over into equity of the Acquisition\\n      Company a significant portion of the Shares held by them and Mr. Barasch would\\n      contribute and roll-over into equity of the Acquisition Company a significant\\n      portion of the Shares beneficially owned by him and (ii) all of the Shares\\n      outstanding at the effective time of the merger not rolled-over into equity\\n      of\\n      the Acquisition Company (including Shares held by the Cap Z Entities and Mr.\\n      Barasch not rolled-over into equity of the Acquisition Company) would be\\n      converted into the right to receive $18.15 per Share in cash.\\n     \\n    The\\n      Sponsors and Mr. Barasch have received a “highly confident” letter from each of\\n      Goldman Sachs Credit Partners L.P. and Banc of America Securities LLC with\\n      respect to proposed debt financing for the proposed transaction (together,\\n      the\\n“Debt Financing Letters”). Copies of the Debt Financing Letters are attached\\n      hereto as Exhibit D and Exhibit E, respectively. It is anticipated that the\\n      balance of the cash required to finance the proposed transaction would be\\n      provided as equity capital by certain of the Sponsors’ respective investment\\n      funds.\\n     \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n        \\n      \\n      \\n        \\n        \\n        \\n          \\n        \\n      \\n      \\n        \\n        \\n        CUSIP\\n          No.\\n          913377107                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Page 6\\n          of 20 Pages\\n      \\n    \\n    The\\n      information set forth in this Item 4 is qualified by reference to the Proposal\\n      Letter and the Debt Financing Letters, which are incorporated herein by\\n      reference.\\n     \\n    The\\n      foregoing should not be construed as an offer to shareholders to purchase\\n      Shares. If definitive agreements providing for the proposed transaction are\\n      entered into with the Issuer, a proxy or other appropriate statement would\\n      be\\n      distributed to shareholders of the Issuer, and shareholders should read that\\n      statement and other relevant documents that may be filed with the Securities\\n      and\\n      Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) (if and when they become available) because they\\n      will contain important information relevant to the decision to approve the\\n      proposed transaction.

However,\\n      each of the Reporting Persons reserves the right to change its plans at any\\n      time, as it deems appropriate, in light of its ongoing evaluation of (a) its\\n      business and liquidity objectives, (b) the Issuer’s financial condition,\\n      business, operations, competitive position, prospects and/or share price, (c)\\n      industry, economic and/or securities markets conditions, (d) alternative\\n      investment opportunities, and (e) other relevant factors.

INTEREST\\n      IN SECURITIES OF THE ISSUER\\n     \\n    (a)-(b) Perry\\n      Corp. is the indirect beneficial owner of 5,820,500 Shares, which constitutes\\n      approximately 9.95% of the Issuer’s outstanding Shares, based on the number of\\n      Shares outstanding as of August 3, 2006 (58,472,243), as reported by the Issuer\\n      in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August 9, 2006 (the\\n      “Form 10-Q”). Perry Corp. has sole power to vote and sole power to dispose of\\n      5,820,500 Shares. By virtue of his position as President, sole director and\\n      sole\\n      shareholder of Perry Corp., Richard C. Perry may be considered to indirectly\\n      beneficially own such Shares.\\n     \\n    By\\n      virtue\\n      of the relationships and as a result of the matters described in the other\\n      Items\\n      of this statement, the Reporting Persons may be deemed to constitute a “group”\\n(within the meaning of Rule 13d-5(b) under the Act) with Mr. Barasch, the\\n      Sponsors and certain of their respective affiliates. Such “group”\\n      may be deemed to\\n      beneficially own Shares that may be beneficially owned by such persons,\\n      including (i) 1,841,309 Shares reflected in the Form 4 filed by Mr. Barasch\\n      on\\n      October 10, 2006 (the “Barasch Form 4”), as being beneficially owned by Mr.\\n      Barasch (which number, per the Barasch Form 4, includes 500,411 Shares, which\\n      are held directly by, or in trust for, members of Mr. Barasch’s immediate family\\n      and as to which Mr. Barasch disclaimed beneficial ownership), (ii) 918,734\\n      Shares that may be acquired by Mr. Barasch through the exercise of stock\\n      options, as reported by Mr. Barasch to the Reporting Persons and (iii)\\n      20,220,236 Shares reflected in Amendment No. 3 to Schedule 13D filed by the\\n      Cap\\n      Z Entities on October 25, 2006 as being beneficially owned by the Cap Z\\n      Entities. On the basis of including such Shares, and based on the information\\n      reported in the Issuer’s proxy statement for its 2006 annual meeting of\\n      stockholders filed with the SEC on May 2, 2006 (the “2006 Proxy Statement”), the\\n      Form 10-Q and the Barasch Form 4, such “group”\\n      may be deemed to\\n      be beneficial owners of, in the aggregate, approximately 49% of the outstanding\\n      Shares. Except as referred to in this statement, the Reporting Persons currently\\n      do not have actual knowledge of beneficial ownership of Shares by any of the\\n      signatories to the Proposal Letter (other than Perry Capital) and the Reporting\\n      Persons have no pecuniary interest with respect to such Shares. Each of the\\n      Reporting Persons disclaims beneficial ownership of Shares that may be\\n      beneficially owned by Mr. Barasch, the Sponsors and their respective affiliates\\n      (other than Perry Capital and its affiliates), and neither the filing of this\\n      statement nor its contents shall be deemed to constitute an admission to the\\n      contrary, except to the extent of the Reporting Persons’ pecuniary interest\\n      therein.\\n     \\n    (c) There\\n      have been no transactions with respect to the Shares during the sixty days\\n      prior\\n      to the date of this statement on Schedule 13D by either Perry Corp. or Richard\\n      C. Perry. Prior to the event date, the Reporting Persons relied on Rule\\n      13d-1(b)(1) under the Act with respect to the reporting of their ownership\\n      of\\n      the Shares.\\n     \\n    (d)\\n       The\\n      limited partners of (or investors in) each of two or more private investment\\n      funds for which Perry Corp. acts as general partner and/or investment adviser\\n      have the right to participate in the receipt of dividends from, or proceeds\\n      from\\n      the sale of, the Shares held for the accounts of their respective funds in\\n      accordance with their respective limited partnership interests (or investment\\n      percentages) in their respective funds.\\n     \\n    (e) Not\\n      applicable.\\n     \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n        \\n      \\n      \\n        \\n        \\n        \\n          \\n        \\n      \\n      \\n        \\n        \\n        CUSIP\\n          No.\\n          913377107                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Page 8\\n          of 20 Pages\\n      \\n    \\n     \\n     \\n    \\n      \\n\\n          \\n            ITEM\\n              6. \\n            \\n              CONTRACTS,\\n                ARRANGEMENTS, UNDERSTANDINGS OR RELATIONSHIPS WITH RESPECT TO\\n                \\n              SECURITIES OF\\n                THE ISSUER \\n            \\n          \\n\\n      \\n    \\n    \\n       \\n    \\n    The\\n      responses to Items 2, 3, 4 and 5 of this statement, and the Proposal Letter\\n      and\\n      the Debt Financing Letters, are incorporated herein by reference.\\n     \\n    Except\\n      for the arrangements described in the responses to Items 2, 3, 4 and 5 of this\\n      statement, and the Proposal Letter and the Debt Financing Letters, to the best\\n      knowledge of the Reporting Persons, there are no contracts, arrangements,\\n      understandings or relationships (legal or otherwise) among the persons named\\n      in\\n      Item 2 of this statement and between such persons and any other person with\\n      respect to any securities of the Issuer, including but not limited to transfer\\n      or voting of any of the securities, finder’s fees, joint ventures, loan or\\n      option arrangements, puts or calls, guarantees of profits, division of profits\\n      or loss, or the giving or withholding of proxies.\\n     \\n    \\n      The\\n        Reporting Persons note that no agreement, arrangement or understanding (whether\\n        or not in writing), for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting, or disposing\\n        of any of the stock of the Issuer directly or indirectly beneficially owned\\n        by\\n        the Reporting Persons, the Cap Z Entities or any of the other Sponsors or\\n        their\\n        affiliates or associates shall exist unless and until such agreement,\\n        arrangement or understanding, or the proposed transaction described herein,\\n        is\\n        expressly approved by the board of directors of the Issuer.\\n    \\n     \\n     \\n    ITEM\\n      7.

Perry Corp. has sole power to vote and sole power to dispose of\\n      5,820,500 Shares. By virtue of his position as President, sole director and\\n      sole\\n      shareholder of Perry Corp., Richard C.

PURPOSE\\n      OF TRANSACTION\\n     \\n    The\\n      Shares were acquired in the ordinary course of business by two or more private\\n      investment funds for which Perry Corp. acts as a general partner and/or\\n      investment adviser. The transactions were broker transactions. This Schedule\\n      13D\\n      is being filed as a result of the proposed transaction described\\n      below.\\n     \\n    Lee\\n      Equity Partners, LLC, Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe X, L.P., Perry Capital\\n      LLC, an affiliate of Perry Corp. (“Perry Capital”), and Capital Z Partners, Ltd.\\n      (collectively, the “Sponsors”) and Mr. Barasch have submitted to the Issuer’s\\n      board of directors a letter, dated October 24, 2006 (the “Proposal Letter”),\\n      setting forth a proposal for the acquisition of the Issuer for $18.15 per Share\\n      in cash. A copy of the Proposal Letter is attached hereto as Exhibit\\n      C.\\n     \\n    It\\n      is\\n      contemplated that the proposed transaction would be effected through a merger\\n      of\\n      the Issuer with a wholly owned subsidiary of a new company (the “Acquisition\\n      Company”) that would be formed by Mr. Barasch and certain of the Sponsors’\\nrespective investment funds. As a result of the merger, the Issuer would become\\n      wholly owned by the Acquisition Company. The Reporting Persons anticipate that,\\n      in the proposed transaction, (i) the Reporting Persons would contribute and\\n      roll-over into equity of the Acquisition Company all of the Shares held by\\n      them,\\n      the Cap Z Entities would contribute and roll-over into equity of the Acquisition\\n      Company a significant portion of the Shares held by them and Mr. Barasch would\\n      contribute and roll-over into equity of the Acquisition Company a significant\\n      portion of the Shares beneficially owned by him and (ii) all of the Shares\\n      outstanding at the effective time of the merger not rolled-over into equity\\n      of\\n      the Acquisition Company (including Shares held by the Cap Z Entities and Mr.\\n      Barasch not rolled-over into equity of the Acquisition Company) would be\\n      converted into the right to receive $18.15 per Share in cash.\\n     \\n    The\\n      Sponsors and Mr. Barasch have received a “highly confident” letter from each of\\n      Goldman Sachs Credit Partners L.P. and Banc of America Securities LLC with\\n      respect to proposed debt financing for the proposed transaction (together,\\n      the\\n“Debt Financing Letters”). Copies of the Debt Financing Letters are attached\\n      hereto as Exhibit D and Exhibit E, respectively. It is anticipated that the\\n      balance of the cash required to finance the proposed transaction would be\\n      provided as equity capital by certain of the Sponsors’ respective investment\\n      funds.\\n     \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n        \\n      \\n      \\n        \\n        \\n        \\n          \\n        \\n      \\n      \\n        \\n        \\n        CUSIP\\n          No.\\n          913377107                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Page 6\\n          of 20 Pages\\n      \\n    \\n    The\\n      information set forth in this Item 4 is qualified by reference to the Proposal\\n      Letter and the Debt Financing Letters, which are incorporated herein by\\n      reference.\\n     \\n    The\\n      foregoing should not be construed as an offer to shareholders to purchase\\n      Shares. If definitive agreements providing for the proposed transaction are\\n      entered into with the Issuer, a proxy or other appropriate statement would\\n      be\\n      distributed to shareholders of the Issuer, and shareholders should read that\\n      statement and other relevant documents that may be filed with the Securities\\n      and\\n      Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) (if and when they become available) because they\\n      will contain important information relevant to the decision to approve the\\n      proposed transaction.

INTEREST\\n      IN SECURITIES OF THE ISSUER\\n     \\n    (a)-(b) Perry\\n      Corp. is the indirect beneficial owner of 5,820,500 Shares, which constitutes\\n      approximately 9.95% of the Issuer’s outstanding Shares, based on the number of\\n      Shares outstanding as of August 3, 2006 (58,472,243), as reported by the Issuer\\n      in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August 9, 2006 (the\\n      “Form 10-Q”). Perry Corp. has sole power to vote and sole power to dispose of\\n      5,820,500 Shares. By virtue of his position as President, sole director and\\n      sole\\n      shareholder of Perry Corp., Richard C. Perry may be considered to indirectly\\n      beneficially own such Shares.\\n     \\n    By\\n      virtue\\n      of the relationships and as a result of the matters described in the other\\n      Items\\n      of this statement, the Reporting Persons may be deemed to constitute a “group”\\n(within the meaning of Rule 13d-5(b) under the Act) with Mr. Barasch, the\\n      Sponsors and certain of their respective affiliates. Such “group”\\n      may be deemed to\\n      beneficially own Shares that may be beneficially owned by such persons,\\n      including (i) 1,841,309 Shares reflected in the Form 4 filed by Mr. Barasch\\n      on\\n      October 10, 2006 (the “Barasch Form 4”), as being beneficially owned by Mr.\\n      Barasch (which number, per the Barasch Form 4, includes 500,411 Shares, which\\n      are held directly by, or in trust for, members of Mr. Barasch’s immediate family\\n      and as to which Mr. Barasch disclaimed beneficial ownership), (ii) 918,734\\n      Shares that may be acquired by Mr. Barasch through the exercise of stock\\n      options, as reported by Mr. Barasch to the Reporting Persons and (iii)\\n      20,220,236 Shares reflected in Amendment No. 3 to Schedule 13D filed by the\\n      Cap\\n      Z Entities on October 25, 2006 as being beneficially owned by the Cap Z\\n      Entities. On the basis of including such Shares, and based on the information\\n      reported in the Issuer’s proxy statement for its 2006 annual meeting of\\n      stockholders filed with the SEC on May 2, 2006 (the “2006 Proxy Statement”), the\\n      Form 10-Q and the Barasch Form 4, such “group”\\n      may be deemed to\\n      be beneficial owners of, in the aggregate, approximately 49% of the outstanding\\n      Shares. Except as referred to in this statement, the Reporting Persons currently\\n      do not have actual knowledge of beneficial ownership of Shares by any of the\\n      signatories to the Proposal Letter (other than Perry Capital) and the Reporting\\n      Persons have no pecuniary interest with respect to such Shares. Each of the\\n      Reporting Persons disclaims beneficial ownership of Shares that may be\\n      beneficially owned by Mr. Barasch, the Sponsors and their respective affiliates\\n      (other than Perry Capital and its affiliates), and neither the filing of this\\n      statement nor its contents shall be deemed to constitute an admission to the\\n      contrary, except to the extent of the Reporting Persons’ pecuniary interest\\n      therein.\\n     \\n    (c) There\\n      have been no transactions with respect to the Shares during the sixty days\\n      prior\\n      to the date of this statement on Schedule 13D by either Perry Corp. or Richard\\n      C.
